Create a gif of N dots orbiting each other based on the factorization of N.

How to run:
1. Download all files.
2. Run `python factor_orbit.py N` where N is the number of dots you want in the animation. For example `python factor_orbit.py 100`.
3. For information on other options, run `python factor_orbit.py -h`.
